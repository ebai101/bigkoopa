Controlling CC turtles from a websockets server.
This should let me iterate way faster over turtle program designs, and theoretically do much more complex stuff using the turtles as essentially an I/O device.
It also means I can program turtles in Python instead :)

The turtle Lua program essentially just breaks out the turtle API to a websocket, which can be used by the server.
